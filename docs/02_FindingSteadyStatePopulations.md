# Calculating Steady-State Occupations

Having found the eigenstates of the electronic Hamiltonian, we now want to find the relative populations of these eigenstates under illumination. To do this, we need to solve the rate equations of the system which are 

$G_{\alpha} + \sum_{\beta}^{\alpha \neq \beta} \left( k_{\beta\alpha}P_{\beta} - k_{\alpha \beta}P_{\alpha} \right) - k_{rec}^{\alpha}P_{\alpha} = 0$

in which $P_{\alpha}$ is the population of the eigenstate $\alpha$ and where we have defined the following rates:
* The rate at which the eigenstate $\alpha$ is generated by the illuminaton, $G_{\alpha}$.
* The rate at which the population of the eigenstate $\alpha$ are transferred into the eigenstate $\beta$, $k_{\alpha \beta}$. 
* The rates at which the eigenstate $\alpha$ returns to the ground state, $k_{rec}^{\alpha}$. 

In this section, we will describe how these rates are calculated within this exemplar, though we note that this part of the model can be adjusted to accomaodte different levels of theory. 

# Generation Rates
To calculate the generation rate into a given eigenstate, we assign a generation probability to excitonic basis states, which is determined by the transition_dipole_ex parameter ($G_{\mathrm{ex}}$). 

$G_{\alpha} =  \sum_{k}G_{\mathrm{ex}}|c_{kk}^{\alpha}|^{2}$  

where the summation over $k$ evaulates the contirubtion to the eigenstate from excitonic basis states, $|k,k\rangle$.
