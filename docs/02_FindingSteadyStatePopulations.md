# Calculating Steady-State Occupations

Having found the eigenstates of the electronic Hamiltonian, we now want to find the relative populations of these eigenstates under illumination. To do this, we need to solve the rate equations of the system which are 

$G_{\alpha} + \sum_{\beta}^{\alpha \neq \beta} \left( k_{\beta\alpha}P_{\beta} - k_{\alpha \beta}P_{\alpha} \right) - k_{rec}^{\alpha}P_{\alpha} = 0$

in which $P_{\alpha}$ is the population of the eigenstate $\alpha$ and where we have defined the following rates:
* The rate at which the eigenstate $\alpha$ is generated by the illuminaton, $G_{\alpha}$.
* The rate at which the population of the eigenstate $\alpha$ **decreases** due to population transfer **into** the eigenstate $\beta$, $k_{\alpha \beta}$.
* The rate at which the population of the eigenstate $\alpha$ **increases** due to population transfer **from** the eigenstate $\beta$, $k_{\beta \alpha}$.
* The rates at which the eigenstate $\alpha$ returns to the ground state, $k_{rec}^{\alpha}$. 

In this section, we will describe how these rates are calculated within this exemplar, though we note that this part of the model can be adjusted to accommodate different levels of theory. 

# Generation Rates
To calculate the generation rate into a given eigenstate, we assign a generation probability to excitonic basis states, which is determined by the `transition_dipole_ex` parameter ($G_{\mathrm{ex}}$). 

$G_{\alpha} =  \sum_{k}G_{\mathrm{ex}}|c_{kk}^{\alpha}|^{2}$  

where the summation over $k$ evaulates the contribution to the eigenstate from excitonic basis states, $|k,k\rangle$. This can be thought of as a way of characterising how much of the eigenstate is made up from excitonic basis states. A value close to one implies that the eigenstate is an exciton, while a value close to zero indicates that the eigenstate has charge transfer character. 

# Recombination Rates

In our exemplar, the recombination of eigenstates to the ground state is assumed to be dominated by non-radiative recombination. We model this in one of two ways, depending upon the value of the `const_recombination` argument of the `Parameters` class. If this is set to True, a recombination rate is assigned to excitonic basis states using the `krec_ex` parameter. Then, the total recomination rate of the eigenstate $\alpha$ is calculated as 

$k_{rec}^{\alpha} =  \sum_{k}k_{\mathrm{rec,ex}}|c_{kk}^{\alpha}|^{2}$ 

Alternatively, if the `const_recombination` argument of the `Parameters` class is set to False, the decay rates are calculated using a version of Fermi's Golden Rule which has been adapted to describe organic molecules. This is described in further detail in [Appendix One](A1_EnergyDependentRecombinationRates.md).
