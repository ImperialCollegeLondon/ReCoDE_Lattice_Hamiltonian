# Calculating Steady-State Occupations

Having found the eigenstates of the electronic Hamiltonian, we now want to find the relative populations of these eigenstates under illumination. To do this, we need to solve the rate equations of the system which are 

in which Pa is the population of the eigenstate a and where we have defined the following rate:
	The rates at which states are generated by the illuminaton
	The rates at which populations are transferred between eigenstates
	The rates at which the excited states return to the ground state i.e., their recombination rates
In this section, we will describe how these rates are calculated within this exemplar, though we note that this part of the model can be adjusted to accomaodte different levels of theory. 

# Generation Rates

# Recombination Rates

# Rates of Population Transfer
