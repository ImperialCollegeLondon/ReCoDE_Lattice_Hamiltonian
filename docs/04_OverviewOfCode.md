The structure of the code is illustrated in the above schematic. The core of the code is the `lattice` class in the `lattice.py` file. This class contains all the subfunctions needed to construct the Hamiltonian (`generate_uniform` and `build_ham`), find its eigenstates ('states_from_ham') and calculate their steady-state populations ('get_rates_mat' and 'solve_steady'). The functions `states_from_ham` and `get_rates_mat` call on helper functions from the files `Recombination.py` and `Redfield.py`, respectively, though `Recombination.py` is only used if `const_recombination` is set to `False` (see ]
