In general, it is best to play around a bit with the number of processes you use to find out what is best for your particular situation. "

    "For the 5x5 lattice, parallelisation is not a very effective way to speed up the code as the time it takes for a typical desktop computer to create the pool of workers negates the time saved by running the parameter sweep in parallel. However, for a larger lattice, the time taken to solve the Hamiltonian far exceeds the time required to make the pool and so parallelisation significantly reduces the total runtime."
